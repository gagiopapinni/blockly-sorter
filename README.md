# blockly-sorter
The project is devoted to basic sorting algorithms,\
It pretends to be a place where students(or anyone else) would feel comfortable
to fiddle with algorithms to understand them better.

### Building:

`$ npm install` downloads all the needed packages into `./node_modules` dir.\
`$ gulp uncompressed` generates the `./uncompressed.js` ( wich is used in debug_index.html )\
`$ gulp compressed` compiles the code into a single `./compressed.js` file (is used in index.html)
